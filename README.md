<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We wanted to make an app that provides census data for a specific city in the US. The tool can be used by people thinking about moving to another city for a job. All data is pulled from the Census bureau's API. We added a cool feature for ranking the happiest cities as well. This is subjective data pulled from WalletHub. Not all cities are on the list, so we provide an encouragement to get on the list!</p>
